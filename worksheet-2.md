# Taking Processing Further with Physical Computing

Processing is so awesome that there are too many features to mention in just one tutorial! If you feel like you have got to grips with the [first page](worksheet.md), and you would like learn how to use Processing for physical computing, then follow the steps below.

This worksheet will show the basics of input and output with Processing. To get a deeper understanding of what you can do with physical computing, check out the Physical Computing guide.

## Control an LED
Throughout this worksheet, you'll be using the GPIO header on the Raspberry Pi. Only the numbered pins below may be used as inputs and outputs.

1. Wire up an LED and a 330 ohm resistor to GPIO pin 17 as shown below. If you need more guidance, follow this guide (LINK TK - physical computing guide).

## What next?
- Try using code to create a piece of animated artwork.
- Do you have any other electronic components to wire up and use with Processing?
- Why not take a look at the [Exhibition section of Processing.org](https://processing.org/exhibition/) and get inspired for your next project?
