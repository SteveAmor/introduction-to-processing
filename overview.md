[Processing](https://processing.org/) is an open-source development environment and programming language, designed for learning how to code. While it's very flexible and powerful, it's mainly used in the realm of visual arts. Processing was created by Ben Fry and Casey Reas in 2001. With the help of Dan Shiffman, they continue to lead [a team of volunteer developers](https://processing.org/people/) to enhance and maintain the project. As a participant in Google's Summer of Code, Gottfried Haider worked on Raspberry Pi support and the GPIO libraries.
